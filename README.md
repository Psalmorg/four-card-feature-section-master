## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the process of attempting this challenge, i learnt:
- about how to use ```clamp``` for responsive ```font-size```
```css
h1 {
    font-size: clamp(1.5rem,-0.0545rem + 4.444vw, 2.5rem);
}
```
- more  about ```grid``` and its ```properties: grid-template-column grid-row grid-column gap```


### Continued development

During the course of this project, i learnt about ```grid``` and ```clamp``` for responsive ```font-size```. I want to have better understanding of the two, most especislly the ```grid```

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This help to understand how to use ```clamp``` and do it calculation.
- [Webdev](https://www.webdev.com) - This helps in ```grid``` aspect
